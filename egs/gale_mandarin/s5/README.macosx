Mac OSX
====

This recipe is incompatible with MacOS flavours of sed / awk / readlink. In order to fix this problem you must create a bin dir and link the GNU flavours of those binaries in there, then you must add that dir to the begining of the PATH variable.

```
mkdir -p bin
ln -s /usr/local/bin/gawk bin/awk
ln -s /usr/local/bin/gsed bin/sed
ln -s /usr/local/bin/greadlink bin/readlink

echo 'export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH' >> path.sh
```
